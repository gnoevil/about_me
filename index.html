      <h2>Job Experience</h2>
      <p>Navy was my life for 20 years, and it put me in a lot of places that pushed me in my leadership and team building experience.  Towards the end of my career in the Navy I started an E-Commerce website where I developed enough income and vision to see my goals clearly.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>Make that computer money honestly.  Also I would like to find an opportunity to travel as well in my work.  I continue to seek oportunities to get further involved in the social activism. We can make a change, and through my coding and deeply invested skills for helping and better people, I can help.</p>
